V3.0.19
-------
 - fixing an error closing some viewers(the action of closing some viewers closes Scipion completely)
 - fixing an error drawing the protocols step tree
 - fixing an error deleting a protocol by the keyboard
 - logging DEBUG mode will be activated when toggling debug mode
 - A dramatic plugin import error will be tolerated. Plugin will not be loaded.
 - Possible outputs definition is now possible. Protocols can define possible outputs to allow designing
   a workflow in advance without executing them.

 Developers:
 - Possible Outputs allowed: dict or enum definition possible, see Protocol._possibleOutput
 - Allow readonly parameters in protocols. Useful in combination with wizards or just informative parameters.

V3.0.18
-------
 - Fixed GUI errors:
   - fixing the workflow collapse/expande nodes
   - resetting nodes with manual subset looses the parent
